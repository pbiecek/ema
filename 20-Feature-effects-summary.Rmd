# Summary of Explainers for Feature Effects {#summaryFeatureEffects}

In previous chapters we introduced different was to calculate model level explainers for feature effects. 
A natural question is how these approaches are different and which one should we choose.

An example that illustrate differences between these approaches is presented in Figure \@ref{accumulatedLocalEffects}.
Here we have a model $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1*x_2 + x_2$ and what is important features are correlated $x_1 \sim U[-1,1]$ and $x_2 = x_1$.

We have 8 points for which we calculated instance level profiles.

| $x_1$  | $x_2$ |
|--------|-------|
|    -1  |   -1  |
| -0.71  | -0.71 |
| -0.43  | -0.43 |
| -0.14  | -0.14 |
|  0.14  |  0.14 |
|  0.43  |  0.43 |
|  0.71  |  0.71 |
|    1   |    1  |

Panel A) shows Ceteris Paribus for 8 data points, the feature $x_1$ is on the OX axis while $f$ is on the OY. 
Panel B) shows Partial Dependency Profiles calculated as an average from CP profiles.

$$
g_{PD}^{f,1}(z) = E[z*x^2 + x^2] = 0
$$
Panel C) shows Conditional Dependency Profiles calculated as an average from conditional CP profiles. In the figure the conditioning is calculated in four bins, but knowing the formula for $f$ we can calculated it directly as.

$$
g_{CD}^{f,1}(z) = E[X^1*X^2 + X^2 | X^1 = z] = z^2+z
$$

Panel D) shows Accumulated Local Effects calculated as accumulated changes in conditional CP profiles. In the figure the conditioning is calculated in four bins, but knowing the formula for $f$ we can calculated it directly as.

$$
g_{AL}^{f,1}(z) = \int_{z_0}^z E\left[\frac{\partial (X^1*X^2 + X^2)}{\partial x_1}|X^1 = v\right] dv  = \int_{z_0}^z E\left[X^2|X^1 = v\right] dv  = \frac{z^2 -1 }{2},
