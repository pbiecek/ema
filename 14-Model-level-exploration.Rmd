# Introduction to Model Level Exploration {#modelLevelExploration}

In Part I, we focused on instance-level explainers, which help to understand how a model yields a prediction for a single observation (instance). 

In Part II, we concentrate on model-level explainers, which help to understand how model's predictions perform in general, for a set of observations. This is the main difference from the instance level explainers that were focused on a model behaviour around a single observation. Model level explainers work in the context of a sample from a general population.

We can think about the following situations as examples:

* We may want to learn which variables are ''important'' in the model. For instance, we may be interested in predicting the risk of heart attack. Explanatory variables are obtained based on results of some medical examinations. If some of the examinations do not influence model's predictions, we could simplify the model by removing the corresponding variables.
* We may want to understand how a selected variable influences model's predictions? For instance, we may be interested in predicting prices of apratments. Apartment's location is an important factor, but we may want to know which locations lead to higher prices? 
* We may want to discover whether there are any observations, for which the model does not seem to give correct predictions. For instance, for a model predicting the probability of survival after a risky treatment, we might know whether there are patients for whom the model predictions are extremely wrong. Identifying such a group of patients might point to, for instance, an incorrect form of or even a missed explanatory variable. 

Model-level explainers focus on four main aspects of a model. 

* Variable's importance: which explantory variables are ''important'', and which are not?
* Variable's effect: how does a variable influence average model's predictions? 
* Model's performance: how ''good'' is the model? Is one model ''better'' than another?
* Model's fit: which observations are misfitted by the model, where residual are the largest? 

In all cases, measures capturing a particular aspect of the model have to be defined. We will discuss them in subsequent chapters. In particular, in Chapter \@ref{featureImportance}, we discuss methods for assessment of explanatory variable's importance. Chapter \@ref{featureEffects} is devoted to approaches that allow evaluation of a variable's effect on model's predictions. 
Chapter \@ref{performanceDiagnostic} shows different approaches to measuring of model performance. Chapter \@ref{residualDiagnostic} is about residual diagnostic.
