# Do-it-yourself With R  {#RCodeSnippets}

In our book we introduce different methods for instance-level and global explanation and exploration of predictive models. In each chapter, there is a section with code snippets for R that show how a particular method has been implemented. In this chapter we provide a short description of steps that will allow the reader to replicate the results presented for various methods.

## What to install?

Obviously, R [@RcoreT] is needed. It is always better to use the newest version, but at least R in version 3.5 should be used. R can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/.

A good editor makes working with R much easier. There is a plenty of choices, but, especially for beginners, it is worth considering the RStudio editor, an open-source and enterprise-ready tool for R. It can be downloaded from  https://www.rstudio.com/.

Once R and the editor are available, the required packages should be installed.

The most important one is the `DALEX` package. It is the entry point to solutions introduced in this book. The  package can be installed by executing the following command from the R command line:

```
install.packages("DALEX")
```

Installation of `DALEX` will automatically take care about installation of other hard requirements (packages required by it), like the `ggplot2` package for data visualization. 

To repeat all examples in this book, two additional packages are needed: `ingredients` and `iBreakDown`. The easiest way to get them, including other useful weak dependencies, is to execute the following command:

```
DALEX::install_dependencies()
```

## How to work with `DALEX`?

To conduct model exploration with `DALEX`, first, a model has to be created. Then the model has got to be prepared for exploration.

There are many packages in R that can be used to construct a model. Some packages are structure-specific, like `randomForest` for Random-Forest Classification and Regression models [@randomForest], `gbm` for Generalized Boosted Regression Models [@gbm], extensions for Generalized Linear Models [@rms], or many others. There is also a number of packages that can be used for constucting models with different structures. These include the `h2o` package [@h2oPackage], `caret` [@caret] and its successor `parsnip` [@parsnipPackage], a very powerful and extensible `mlr` [@mlr], or `keras` that is a wrapper to Python library with the same name [@kerasPackage].

While it is great to have such a large choice of tools for constructing models, the downside is that different  packages have different interfaces and different arguments. Moreover, model-objects created with different packages  may have different internal structures. The main goal of the `DALEX` package [@R-DALEX] is to create a level of abstraction around a model that makes it easier to explore and explain the model.

Function `DALEX::explain` is THE function for model wrapping. The function requires five arguments: 

* `model`, a model-object;
* `data`, a data frame with validation data;
* `y`, observed values of the dependent variable for the validation data; it is an optional argument, required for explainers focused on model validation and benchmarking.
* `predict_function`, a function that returns prediction scores; if not specified, then a default `predict()` function is used. Note that, for some models, the default `predict()` function returns classes; in such cases you should provide a function that will return numerical scores. 
* `label`, a name of a model; if not specified, then it is extracted from the `class(model)`. This name will be presented in figures, so it is recommended to make the name informative.

For an example, see Section \@ref(ExplainersTitanicRCode).

## How to work with `archivist`?

As we will focus on exploration of predictive models, we prefer not to waste space nor time on replication of the code necessary for model development. This is where the `archivist` packages helps.

The `archivist` package [@archivist] is designed to store, share, and manage R objects. We will use it to easily access R models and explainers. To install the package, the following command should be executed in the R command line:

```
install.packages("archivist")
```

Once the package has been installed, function `aread()` can be used to retrieve R objects from any remote repository. For this book, we use a GitHub repository `models` hosted at https://github.com/pbiecek/models. For instance, to download a model with the md5 hash `ceb40`, the following command has to be executed:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
archivist::aread("pbiecek/models/ceb40")
```

Since the md5 hash `ceb40` uniquely defines the model, referring to the repository object results in using exactly the same model and the same explanations. Thus, in the subsequent chapters, pre-constructed model explainers will be accessed with `archivist` hooks.
